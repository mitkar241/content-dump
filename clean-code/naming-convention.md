# Naming Convention
---

- Dont name single letter variables / structs etc e.g. A, B, C

- Provide meaningful names clearly explining there purpose. Avoid ambiguity. e.g. `MIN_PWD = 6` vs `MIN_PWD_LEN = 6`

- Function names should be verbs - for the specific task the function does

- boolean variables should be named such that its answer is True / False - e.g. `isValidUder`, `checkPwdLen()` vs `isPwdLongEnough()`
