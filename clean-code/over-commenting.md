# Over Commenting
---

- if a function name / line of code clearly showcases what it is doing, there is no point in having a comment on top of it to explain its purpose.

- The only scenarios where comments make sense are lines where the complex logic / significance of a conditional / operation is difficult to figure out from the code flow itself - say in the line of Domain Knowledge.

- If line(s) of code is so complex that we have to comment to add readability, perhaps think through again if it can be simplified.
